# Note: underscores "_" are not allowed in labels

# List projects (i.e. classes, or research projects)
# Each project has services.
# There are two types of services:
# * external
# * internal
#
# Internal services are unique for a user, and run
# under their privilidges and use their home directory
# For example, this can be a jupyter notebook, or an IDE
#
# External services are run under their own user,
# in their own privite home directory.
# For example, this can be a shared dashboard, a database,
# or perhaps some cluster software where computational
# tasks can be sent.
#
# Note that, in principle, internal services can be shared
# too. For example, a user might want to quickly share
# their work with collaborators.
#
# Though, for security reasons, maybe that isn't a good idea.
# Because a rogue internal service would be able to access all
# files of that user...
#
# If external: true/false flag is not set, it is assumed to be
# false. I.e. by default services are internal. Set
# `external: true` to make them external.

# projects.<project name>.services.<service name>.internal
# allows specifying shortcuts for urls inside that <service name>
# for example, http://jh.com/<... service name ...>/lab for jupyter lab
